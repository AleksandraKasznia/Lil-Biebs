I'm afraid to say the wrong thing
Criticized from every angle
And I'm afraid to lay it on the line
And selfishly I wanna hold back
Do we got the room to make mistakes?
Are we judged for everything we said? Ooh, ooh, ooh
I wanna grow but I'm afraid Ooh, ooh, ooh
And will it always be the same? Ooh, ooh, ooh
Does what I gotta say even matter? Ooh, ooh, ooh
Is life about climbing up the ladder Ooh, ooh, ooh
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybody's getting canceled
And can't there be room for maturity?
'Cause writing 'em off is not the answer
Do we got the room to make mistakes? Ooh, ooh, ooh, do we?
Are we judged for everything we said? Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, are we?
I wanna grow but I'm afraid Ooh, ooh, ooh
And will it always be the same? Ooh, ooh, ooh
Does what I gotta say even matter? Ooh, ooh, ooh
Is life about climbing up the ladder Ooh, ooh, ooh
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybody's getting canceled Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
And can't there be room for maturity?
'Cause writing 'em off is not the answer
We can't write people off
God never writes us off
Even in our darkest days, even when we least deserve it
Even when we're doing that stupid thing we wish we weren't doing
God never writes us off, ever
He's with us in our pain, He's with us in our struggle
He's with us in our bad decisions
He's with us all the time, He never writes us off He never writes us off
You formed the whole of me Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh
Inward and out Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh
I am awesomely and wonderfully created Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh
Your creations are spectacular
You skillfully designed me Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh
You saw the essence of me, before I was formed
Before I existed, all of my days were written in your book
Psalms 139:13-16
When the day is over
And those thoughts set in
It's when I start to wonder
Where do I fit in
But then you remind me
That you're holding me tight
You say the past is behind me
And it'll be alright
And you say to me
It'll be alright
When I'm all alone and
Fear is all I see
Sitting in the silence
With these insecurities
It's then you remind me
You're holding me tight
And you love me completely
You're always by my side
And you say to me
It'll be alright, mhm...
I know you're not a God out there hiding on mountains, oh, no
You come right where I am
Lost my way but you found me
Like the ray in the dark, on my ugliest days
You say that you'll always love me just the same
And then you remind me
That you're holding me tight
You said the past is behind me
And it will be alright
Ooh...
And you say to me
It'll be alright
Ooh...
Gonna be alright
Gonna be alright
It will, it will be alright
I hear those words over and over
It'll be alright
Go to sleep, my child
It'll be alright
Sleep silently, my child
It'll be alright
I'm right here, my child
It'll be alright
I won't go anywhere
It'll be alright
You're in the palm of my hand
It'll be alright
My arms are wrapped around you
It'll be alright
While you sleep I watch over you
It'll be alright
I'll take care of your loved ones
It'll be alright
Your future is in my hands
It'll be alright
Your past is forgiven
It'll be alright
Your future is secure
It'll be alright
I forgive you
It'll be alright
I'm your friend, this is closer than a brother
It'll be alright
Sleep now
For when the morning comes, my mercies will be new
It'll be alright
Hallelujah
Where You go, I follow
You're with me every step of the way
Here in the struggle
Your love's enough to wash it all away
On the third day, yeah, You rose up
And You beat death once and for all
Once and for all
There's nobody like You
There's nobody like You, Jesus
There'll never be nobody like You
There'll never be nobody like You, Jesus
Sometimes this world is feeling crazy
At times my mind is feeling hazy
But Lord, You always come and save me
God Almighty, my safety
You're my end, You're my new beginning
You're my home, the one I confide in
You're the very air I breathe
The reason that I'm safe
Oh, I've tried it all
Nothing could fix the damage in my heart
Till I met You, Lord
Oh, You gave Your life so I won't fall apart
Oh, on the third day, yeah, You rose up
And You beat death once and for all
Once and for all, yeah
There's nobody like You
There's nobody like You, Jesus
There'll never be nobody like You
There'll never be nobody like You, Jesus
Why? Why is there nobody like Jesus?
Hasn't billions of men and women lived on this planet?
But why, why are we convinced there's nobody like Jesus?
Was He not merely a teacher, a prophet
An exegeter, an explainer and yet we find ourselves in history wondering
"Is there anyone like Jesus?
Who is this Jesus?"
This Man from the Middle East who claims to be God
Is He God? Is He sinless? Is He perfection?
Is He the once and for all sacrifice for humanity?
Is He a man without fear?
Did He become sin so that you and I might become right in our relationship with God?
Is there nobody like Jesus?
Did He die between two criminals on the crucifixion?
Three days later, did He rise again as the grave empty?
Has He defeated death, Hell in the grave and sin itself?
If so, there is nobody like Jesus...
Yeah
It's not easy growing up
You know?
Only two years old, I was playing drums on the table
Guess I knew it was the only thing stable
When I was young I could pick things up quick
Anything that I did, I was pretty good at it
Well, I started school, I was a troublemaker
Thought I knew everything in life, yeah, that caught up to me later
I had to learn about humility
I had to grow up and accept responsibility
Yeah, that wasn't easy 'cause at seventeen I had a milli
Women throwing themselves at me had me going silly
On the surface I felt like the man
But deep inside I felt deprived just like an empty can
I've had everything in life that people strive for
Just to ask the question, what are we alive for?
What you believe and what you agree with, who would you die for?
Is there a reason, what is the meaning, what do we cry for?
One thing I know is we're in this together, together
One thing I know is we're in this together, together
We're in this together
I moved out when I was eighteen
I was living in a mansion doing big things
F.B.I. raided my house and shit was getting dicey
I was doing stupid shit to get people to like me
All that to say, I'm thankful that's not who I am
And I'm thankful God was with me when shit hit the fan
'Cause He's the reason that I'm still standing
And even in a pandemic God is still planning
Planning peace, planning joy, plan another day
Gave His life up on the cross to wash His sins away
I've had everything in life that people strive for
Just to ask the question, what are we alive for?
What you believe and what you agree with, who would you die for?
Is there a reason, what is the meaning, what do we cry for?
One thing I know is we're in this together, together
One thing I know is we're in this together, together
We're in this together
I pray for every single person listening to this song right now
I pray for peace, I pray for joy, I pray for confidence, I pray for reassurance
I thank You so much for the person listening to this right now
I pray that You would bless them, bless their mind, bless their finances
Bless their family, bless their sons, bless their daughters
Bless their moms, bless their dads, bless their grandparents
God, I just pray for an overwhelming sense of Your presence in their home right now
An overwhelming sense of Your peace that says, "Everything is going to be alright"
In the name of Jesus
In the name of Jesus
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We reject what we don't understand
We turn our backs on a fellow man
I wanna change, but my heart is bleedin'
Heart is hard, and can't nobody see me
I wanna be there for the ones that need me
I can't stand the pain I see on TV
Jealous 'cause they wanna be me
Damn it man, this life ain't easy
It takes over me
My unforgiveness keeps control of me
Damnit, I gotta get a hold of me
Gotta get a hold of me, oh
What you want out of life? That's the question
This ain't a simulation, it's a blessing
Is it a mistake or is it destined?
We ain't got no time for second guessin'
We can't save ourselves, we need a savior
We ain't make ourselves, we need a maker
I keep failin' myself, I need somethin' new
So I lay my life down, I give it all to you
All to you, give it all to you I give it all to you
Give it all to you, give it all I give it all to you
Oh, oh
I came to the end of me, believin' the enemy
Comin' with that "Mmm", man, you ain't a friend of me
Nothing can fix that, ooh, not even the Hennessy
I had to switch it up, yeah, switch up the remedy
God, can you use imperfect people? Oh
'Cause I'm broken through and through Oh
Just tell me where I need to go Need to go
'Cause that's all that I wanna do All that I wanna do
I'm a mess, but I'm tryna grow
I'm upset, but I still wanna know
Is there more for my life
Or is that all she wrote? Is that all she wrote?
Uh, is that all she wrote? Is that all that she wrote?
Is that all she wrote? Is that all that she wrote?
Is that all she wrote?
Thanks to all them Judas kisses, I got a master's in forgiveness
I don't need a jail system, I walk in conviction
I'd rather pray to God, than pray for wishes
I'm supernatural, not superstitious, there's a difference
Like relationship versus religion, that's a prison
I'm lightin' circle, then royal purple inside a prism
This flow is so universal, it came with dreams and visions
I got the keys to the kingdom, I'm 'bout my father business
I came up straight from the bottom, I started from the finish
You can't undermine a mastermind
I may be out of your mind, but I ain't out of mine
I'm co-crucified, bury, resurrected
And perfected in the Son of God
Just like water turn to wine, I'm a prophetic sign
Ask your barber, I'ma headliner in New York Times
My life verses, I am His, yeah, and He is mine
The great "I Am's", the greatest Lamb of all time
Rebranded, redesigned and redefined
From Brandon to brand new
I'ma brand name in the household, brand too
Who are you to try to tell me what I can't do?
Winnie The Pooh, huh?
You ever ask yourself "Am I gonna make it?"
Well, I don't know, of course I can fake it
But honestly, can I go wrong?
I'm so tired, I'm so broken, I'm so weary
Oh, God, oh, God
Big up to my brother
Blessed sons and daughters
We all lookin' for the answers
We in search of living water
Too blind to see the Messiah
Are you weary? Are you tired?
Runnin' on empty, feelin' the fire

Like looking in a mirror, trying to steady yourself
And seeing somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killing me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fucking lonely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did
As an idiot kid
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fucking lonely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
Dance with me under the diamonds

I thought I painted a picture of heaven
But it turns out
It's just your room

Displaced and stretched it out in every way
Crossing every line yeah
T-T-Touch base until you find the chemistry
And I know this ain't rocket science
And I never leave the house
Without checking on you first
And begin to wonder
Next time that I ge ge ge ge get her, I'ma tell her In every kind of way

[Martin Luther King Jr.:]
I say to you this morning, that if you have never found something so dear and so precious to you that you will die for it, then you aren't fit to live
You may be 38 years old as I happen to be
And one day some great opportunity stands before you
And calls upon you to stand up for some great principle
Some great issue, some great cause
And you refuse to do it because you are afraid
You refuse to do it because you want to live longer
You're afraid that you will lose your job
Or you're afraid that you will be criticized
Or that you will lose your popularity
Or you're afraid that somebody will stab you or shoot at you or bomb your house
And so you refuse to take the stand
Well you may go on and live until you are 90
But you're just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90
And the sensation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit
You died when you refused to stand up for right
You died when you refused to stand up for truth
You died when you refused to stand up for justice

Sometimes I think I overthink
And I start to feel anxiety
There were times I couldn't even breathe
But you never once abandoned me

I tried to scare you
Scare you away
Showed you the door
You adored me anyway
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind
You were my peace of mind

Yeah you love, yeah you love, you loved me
When I was unstable

Never judge, never judge, never judged me
When I was unable
To love myself, to trust myself

Yeah you love, yeah you love, you loved me
When I was unstable

White knuckles tryna own my sanity
Not every wound is the kind that bleeds
Never know when my mind's gonna turn on me
But you're the one I call for security
These memories have been toxic
I tried to ween and get off it
Through everything you been my rock
I think you're the only thing I didn't get wrong
Oh I know God was listening
Every night when I would pray
You're an angel watching over me
All I need

I tried to scare you
Scare you away
Showed you the door
You adored me anyway
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind
You were my peace of mind

Yeah you love, yeah you love, you loved me
When I was unstable

Never judge, never judge, never judged me
When I was unable
To love myself, to trust myself

Yeah you love, yeah you love, you loved me
When I was unstable

I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's making me say

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And no I can't stand it being fake No, no, no, no, no, no no no
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me feels so holy

They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushing"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushing"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me feels so holy
One touch and you got me stoned
Higher than I've ever known
You call the shots and I'll follow

Sunrise but the night's still young
No words but we're speaking tongues
If you let me I might say too much

Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world and I'm just in it
Even sober I'm not thinking straight

'Cause I'm off my face in love with you
I'm out my head so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you
O-o-oh

Can't sleep 'cause I'm way too buzzed
Too late now you're in my blood
I don't hate the way you keep me up

Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world and I'm just in it
Even sober I'm not thinking straight

'Cause I'm off my face in love with you
I'm out my head so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you
O-o-oh

'Cause I'm off my face in love with you
I'm out my head so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you
O-o-oh
By you
O-o-oh
By myself sometimes
To give my mind some space
Yeah I know, yeah I know that it hurts
When I push your love away, I hate myself

When I tell you lies
So your heart won't break
Yeah I know, yeah I know that I made my fair share of mistakes

Sometimes, I don't know why you love me
Sometimes, I don't know why you care
Take me, with the good and the ugly
Say, "I'm not going anywhere"

Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can, say
"I'm not going anywhere"

Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can, say
"I'm not going anywhere"

Thousand miles apart, yeah you're the one that holds my heart
It's no surprise
And I tell you all the time

And when life gets way too hard
I'll meet you in the stars, you know I will
I'll keep you near, mmm as I wipe away your tears, mmm Yes

Sometimes, I don't know why you love me
Sometimes, I don't know why you care
Take me, with the good and the ugly
Say, "I'm not going anywhere"

Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can, say
"I'm not going anywhere" Yeah

Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can, say
"I'm not going anywhere"

You were there for me when I was acting selfish
And you prayed for me when I was out of faith
You believed in me when ain't nobody else did
It's a miracle you didn't run away

You were there for me when I was acting selfish
And you prayed for me when I was out of faith
You believed in me when ain't nobody else did
It's a miracle you didn't run away

Sometimes, I don't know why you love me
Sometimes, I don't know why you care
Take me, with the good and the ugly
Say, "I'm not going anywhere"
When I'm in my thoughts sometimes
It's hard to believe
I'm the person you think I am
The person that you tell me you love
I'm on my ten thousandth life
Nine thousand, nine hundred, ninety nine and it slipped my hands
But this the one I'm not giving up

Night after night you fall asleep on me
I'm praying that I don't go back to who I was

I feel like
I don't deserve you tonight
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight
It's in the things that you show me
I need you, don't let me go
Need you, don't let me go, I feel like
I don't de-, I don't de-, I don't deserve you tonight

I can tend to hold things back
I need you more than I let you believe I do
'Cause you could think it might be too much, oh yeah
I don't want to beat my past
Oh when we kiss I'm alive and I feel brand new
There's nothing that I want more than us

Night after night you fall asleep on me
I'm praying that I don't go back to who I was

I feel like
I don't deserve you tonight
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight
It's in the things that you show me
I need you, don't let me go
Need you, don't let me go
I feel like
I don't de-, I don't de-, I don't deserve you tonight

Somewhere in the sky
The way your body fits on mine
When you give in to me
I'm so high but I'm falling
Uh, and now my eyes are locked on you
As you dance around the room
And finally I'm right where I belong

I feel like
I don't deserve you tonight
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight
It's in the things that you show me
I need you, don't let me go
Need you, don't let me go
I feel like
I don't de-, I don't de-, I don't deserve you tonight
Maybe I stare too much
Maybe not long enough
Funny how I forget to blink
But when you let down your hair
Dancin' like no one's there
I know I'm where I'm s'posed to be
I say I love you under my breath
More times than you can digest
It's music every time I hear your name
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

Don't wanna close my eyes
I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep
I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes
I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep
I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months
And that's too much

I love the way you love your mom
And take on all your friends problems
And still somehow stop the world for us
I still relive the second
I met my biggest blessing
Prayed for you look what God has done

Say I love you under my breath
More times than you could digest
Music every time I hear your name
Your head's laying right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

Don't wanna close my eyes
I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep
I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes
I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep

I'm concerned when you look at my face
You're excited for no reason
I look lost with a drink in my hand
What you think is fair ain't even even
It's cold outside from my expression
Take the scarf and wrap it around my neck
Loosen up my tie

At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now
One finger at a time, I turn the pages, yeah

Right leg crossed while you're smoking a cigarette
Camera's on the couch, ain't nobody taking pictures
Throw my arms around you, bear witness
The stripes on my shirt can you read between the lines
You sip champagne while I sip on red wine
Never mind me watching you, never mind the tension
Please excuse me while I dance, I forgot to mention
I'm going on strike

At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
At least for now, at least for now, oh
Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side

Ooh, and you can trust me
After all the lies I told you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Don't nobody else deserve my time

I reach out to you
But my hands can't hold enough
Enough of your greatness
You teach me patience
Like the best of our worlds collide

Never understood what it meant
It meant to submit to love
So beyond what lust is
Hey, it's a blessing that you're in my life

Make me look even better
When we shine, we shine together
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Don't nobody else deserve my eyes

When you demand my presence, it's hard to read the message
I stay on the defense, to take away your leverage
'Til you put it in perspective
Can't help but to respect it
Oh, now, I know what love is

I know what true love is
Yeah, down in my soul
Far more than you know
My self-esteem gets low, you lift it right up through the ceiling
Ooh-whoa

Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side
No

Ahh-ah-ahh
Ahh-ah-ahh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
That's what love is

That's what love is
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
That's what love is
La-la-la-la-la-la Look at this love
Ain't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now One more time
Ain't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now
Ain't no need in being so anxious
I can hear your heart beating out loud
Quit acting like we're in a race
Begging me you know I'm on the way over
Take a moment to cherish this space
So quick to move forward no pressure and we got the rest

Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
We got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
All you ever really want
All you ever really need is at home
We got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives

Look at how it's all unfolding
Yeah, persistence at its finest
Like you wanted in before the door was open
Instead of letting what's scripted play out
Quit acting like we're in a race
Begging me you know I'm on the way over
Take a moment to cherish this space
So quick to move forward no pressure and we got the rest

Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
We got the rest, Oh woo
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
All you ever really want
All you ever really need is at home
Yeah, we've got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
Some days I move like water
Some days I burn like fire
Some days I wanna push further
Some days I wanna do nothin'

And I just wanna be the best of me
Even though sometimes we might disagree
So that I can be the best for you
That's all I wanna do

I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
Though I'm goin' through changes
Don't mean that I'll change

Sometimes I'll go to sleep early
Sometimes I can't close my eyes
Sometimes I smile like it's all good
Even though there's pain underneath it

I just wanna be the best of me
Even though sometimes I forget to breathe
So that I can be the best for you
That's all I wanna do

I be goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
Though I'm goin' through changes
Don't mean that I'll change
Yeah, I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes Ooh, yes I am
Though I'm goin' through changes That's right
Don't mean that I'll change, woah

La-da-da-da-dum, la-da-da-da-dum
La-da-da-da-dum, la-da-da-da-dum, no
La-da-da-da-dum, la-da-da-da-dum
I'm going through changes
No, I ain't changed, yeah
Uh, people change, circumstances change
But God always remains the same
Feels like time's moving in slow motion
Just trying to occupy my mind
So that I don't go looney over you Ooo-ooh
Just trying to amplify the sound
To drown out all of this need for you You-ooo-ooh
Biting my nails got me nervous
So anxious, see it's one o'clock now
Noon felt like three hours ago

I just wanna know your E.T.A
E.T.A., out the window got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another, be honest
What's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?

Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Don't say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean
Love me hard like where you been
Love me like you don't want it to end

I just wanna know your E.T.A
E.T.A., out the window got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another, be honest
What's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?

Before you gotta go Oh-ooo-oh-oh
Drop a pin for me now

In your arms, rubbing on your face
Only place I wanna be
In the bed, where we lay our head
Only place I wanna be

It feels like we're on the same wave, yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances

Keep running over
Me with your loving
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep running over
Me with your loving
Looking like it's turning into something

Wednesday
It felt like a Tuesday when you met me
I remember it like it was yesterday
You just said "Hello", I lost my sanity
Thought you was looking through me
Then you made me laugh with personality
When you said goodbye that was a tragedy
Had to get a lesson in anatomy
You just ran me over

Look out, watch out, got me on the defense
Thought love at first sight was just a false pretense
Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence

Keep running over
Me with your loving
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep running over
Me with your loving
Looking like it's turning into something
Better that than turning into nothing Way-oh, way-oh
Ain't no interrupting this eruption Way-oh, way-oh

LD!
I believe in love
Girl, you got my hopes all up
When I left you, when I met you
I called mom and told her 'bout it
I got all up on your I.G. and was scrolling down for hours
I got back to 2015 and you started looking young, so I stopped Oh
Post intercourse when you walk by Ass, ass, ass
More buns than a Shop Rite Whoa
And you wanna sleep over my crib? Lemme go and get you a soft t-shirt, here Soft-t
What are our kids gonna be like?
What is your skin routine like?

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushing a Monte Carlo
Bet the money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh no
See them heat waves in the desert look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me
Keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missing
Been missing the way you give me envision, babe

Never thought I'd settle down
Reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusing on being by myself
Set my feelings to the side they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothing left

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

When you asked me if I cheated, I said never No way
What are you willing to do to stay together?
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother?

Girl, you're killing me, I don't wanna act like I can fix this Fix it, fix it
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally
But I can't buy your love

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest
Your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Counting the stars with our last name on the license plate
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feeling aside
Let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around

Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

Won't you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Won't you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around

So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing
That's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying
Oh lord

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most

I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken
Yes I did
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping
Can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turn to moping
Tell me...

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
I need you the most
I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just tryna find my way back home
Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why I'm alone, alone, alone

And if I could
Forget about the way you love me
Forget about the world, we're set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground

I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just tryna find my way back home
Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why I'm alone, alone, alone

And if I could
Forget about the way you love me
Forget about the world, we're set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground

Take it one day at a time
Reach for the stars now
Ooh just leave the past behind
It's a part of living
It's a part of living

If only I could hit the ground
If only I could
If only I could hit the ground
I could hit the ground, right now
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be falling down
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be touching down
If only I could hit the ground
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You’re so indecisive, what I’m saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between
Oh, I really want to know…

What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between

Oh baby
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

This is ours baby, yeah
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
You're so confusing baby
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Be more straight forward
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times,
The times you got back up, whoa
You'd be a billionaire in a year
That's what you gotta think 'til you're there
On the regular.

If you got a diamond for all of your passion,
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and
Icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don't condone it,
Love is a component
You're the only opponent,
Gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give each time
'til the water runs dry
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

All in it, all in it

If I had a guitar missing five strings?
A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh
A simple melody, simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing, you know what I mean

If you got a diamond for all of your passion,
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and
Icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don't condone it,
Love is a component
You're the only opponent,
Gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give each time
'Til the water runs dry
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

All in it, all in it

See, growing up I—I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
'Cause I, I just didn't think I was good enough
And maybe if I was good at something, that I'd get recognition from that
But I quickly found out that I wasn't going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed
Because, because people aren't perfect
And by not being perfect you—you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God, it's like He's perfect and He never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from Him
And give Him recognition
Oh, oh, baby
Yeah, oh, oh

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we could be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

Don't let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don't want to be left with the questions "Why?"
Let's be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?

Yeah, sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Well giving up is immature
There's so much more to live for
They don't wanna see us together now
'Cause we're strong enough to endure, whoa

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we could be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer some people separate, yeah
Don't think we should separate
And we both adore one another
You're a dream come true
We should start off brand new
That's what we ought to do, yeah

Sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Well giving up is immature
There's so much more to live for
They don't wanna see us together now
'Cause we're strong enough to endure, whoa

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we could be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

Trust me right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, we gotta learn to trust now
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah-ah-ah
Girl you gotta learn to trust me now
Hey, hey, yeah
If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we could be in love
If you want the best for us
I got the best for us
We gotta learn to trust
We gotta learn to trust
Yeah, whoa, whoa
Happy birthday

You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in that she say I have you livid
No, they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it

They ain't never had your back like I got it
They ain't never had trust like how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it

You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

It's like you're always looking for a problem
But there ain't enough equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Get the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em

They ain't never had my back like you got it
They ain't never had a chance how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it

You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Nas:]
She texts me "How's your love life?" and "How are you? ", I said "I'm good."
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together, warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever, she says whatever
I says whatever, who get you wetter than a half-moon wearer
HSTRY sweater, serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my batch and I'm straight
Esco

Don't question it
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't wanna lose, no
Don't wanna still lose what we are
We can't lose
Lose what we are
Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interests
Our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safe

And then we got closer
Separated from my ex 'til we got closure
Ooh, on every visit, feelings got stronger
Now this is out of our hands
Our love is here to stay

So get used to me checking in all day
Get used to me falling through just to see your face
There ain't a moment I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh, get used to it, hey
Oh, get used to it, hey
Oh, get used to it, oh, it
Oh, used to me holding you
Used to me wowing you
Oh, get used to it

And I'm 'a April-shower you forever if I may
'Til your flowers bloom in June
Make sure that our fireworks be your Fourth of July for life
As long as you stand right by my side

Keep growing closer throughout October
Oh, counting down. It's almost Christmas Eve
Oh, seven days shy of a New Year's Eve
Then we'll be celebrating

So, get used to me checking in all day
Get used to me falling through just to see your face
There ain't a moment I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you
Get used to me loving you

Oh, get used to it, hey
Oh, get used to it, hey
Oh, get used to it, oh, it
Oh, used to me holding you
Used to me wowing you
Oh, get used to it

I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't going nowhere
Oh, no
I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't going nowhere
Oh, no

Put your faith in me
I'll be all you need
I swear
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna be right here
Yeah

So, get used to me checking in all day
Get used to me falling through just to see your face
There ain't a moment I won't need your brace
I'm gonna need you, baby
Get used to me touching you
Get used to me loving you

Oh, get used to it, hey
Oh, get used to it, hey
Oh, get used to it, oh, it
Oh, used to me holding you
Used to me wowing you
Oh, get used to it

You better get used to it
You better get used to it
Get used to it
You better get used to it
You better get used to it
Get used to it
Feeling the remnants, caught in an instance
Blink of an eye, no goodbye
I had a notion, deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky, oh my

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could've just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known,
If I would've known, if I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be—wanted to be your enemy, no,
But if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you

The repercussions, I'm missing your loving
Haunts me tonight,
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Of serenity
Dwindle in my mind
All the time

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could've just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known,
If I would've known, if I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be—wanted to be your enemy, no,
But if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you

If I would've known,
If I would've known, if I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be—wanted to be your enemy, no,
But if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you
Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

I put my all into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach

And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach

And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything

I don't know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it's wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again. We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions

You can't be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that's not who you are. You know you're trying to be the best you can be, but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening

That's what happening with me, it's like "God, I'm giving it all I've got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm going to do it." And it's like I'm not giving myself grace, I'm just like understanding that's how it is

What about the children?
Look at all the children we can change
What about a vision?
Be a visionary for a change
We're the generation
Who's gonna be the one to fight for it?
We're the inspiration
Do you believe enough to die for it, die for it, die for it?

Who's got the heart? Who's got it?
Whose heart is the biggest?
Wear it on your sleeve
Bet we can make a difference, oh, yeah
Who's got the heart? Who's got it?
Whose heart is the biggest? Yeah
Wear it on your sleeve
Bet we can make a difference
Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah
Who's got the heart?
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

What about the children?
Look at all the children we can change
What about a vision?
Be a visionary for a change
We're the generation, oh, whoa
Who's gonna be the one to fight for it? Whoa
We're the inspiration
Do you believe enough to die for it, to die for it?

Who's got the heart? Who's got it?
Whose heart is the biggest?
Wear it on your sleeve
Bet we can make a difference, oh, yeah
Who's got the heart? Who's got it?
Whose heart is the biggest?

Oh, whoa, yeah, oh, whoa
Bet we can make a difference, oh, yeah

Who's got the heart?
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

I need you the I need you
I need you the I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you
I need you the I need you
I need you the I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you
I need you the most

I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can’t deny it
Now I’m all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing, that's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying, oh Lord

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

I need you the I need you
I need you the I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you
Where are you now that I need you?
I need you the I need you
I need you the I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you
I need you the most

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
I need you the most I need you the most, I need you the most

Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't never over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living, ou ou ou ou
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent an angel to help us out, yeah
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't never over
No, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living, ou ou ou ou
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again, oh whoa oh
Life is worth living again

What I get from my reflection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living, oh yeah
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again
You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you?
am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth,
trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you. Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
At least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you?
am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth,
trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you. Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I made you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline
Am I in love with you?
am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth,
trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you.
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Yeah, yeah
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you

Alright
The sun don't set the same 'less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same 'less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house when you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make sense when it's empty oh, no

I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you, boo
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
Oh, been around the world ain't the same without you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you

Focus ain't the same if the picture ain't got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain't the same if it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, boo
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, whoa
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
No, it don't make sense
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
No, it don't make sense, it don't make sense
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
alright, yeah, alright
You ain't gotta answer none of my calls
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself
Oh, no, baby, what I'm saying is

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure

Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'mma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll still
Don't rush, no pressure

Put my key in the ignition
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me
I know that you ain't got no place to leave
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no, no

[Big Sean:]
Look, I know you don't wanna talk, right
We've been on and off like the crosslights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh, no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it

You ain't gotta make your mind up
make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure

Let your heart heal
Don't rush, no pressure
Can we, we keep, keep each other company?
Maybe we can be, be each other's company
Oh, company

Let's set each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink
I tell you what I got in mind
Oh, I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change

You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me "baby"
Never been around, no pressure. Ain't that serious?

Can we, we keep, keep each other company?
Maybe we can be, be each other's company
Oh, company

It ain't about the complications
I'm all about the elevation
We can keep it goin' up
Oh, don't miss out on us
Just wanna have a conversation
Forget about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh, that ain't doin' too much

You ain't gotta be my lover for me to call you "baby"
Never been around, no pressure. Ain't that serious? No.

Can we, we keep, keep each other company?
Maybe we can be, be each other's company
Oh, company

Can we be, can we be, be each other's company,
Be each other's company,
Just be each other's company,
Be each other's company?

Can we, we keep, keep each other company?
Maybe we can be, be each other's company
Oh, company
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own. Well, I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love. Now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think you think that I'm that I'm still holdin' on holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time. Could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness

I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know-oh-oh, that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know-oh-oh, that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm not just trying to get you back on me oh, no, no
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body your body, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know-oh-oh, that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah, I know-oh-oh, that I let you down let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh

My life is a movie and everyone's watching
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense

Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

This life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure

I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

I got to learn things, learn them the hard way
Gotta see what it feels like, no matter what they say

Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

This life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure

I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

This life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure

I'll show you

I'll show you
Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words

So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust
Trying to rekindle us
Only to lose yourself
But I won't let me lose you
And I won't let us just fade away
After all that we've been through
I'mma show you more than I ever could say

Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words

Oh-oh ooh oooooha
Ooh-oh ah
love you, need you
I need you here to stay

Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you woop woop woop
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass boom, boom, boom, boom
She give me butterflies and they won't go away away away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said,
"Love you, need you, need you here to stay."

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

What else, what else, if you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else, if you wanna be my baby

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass boom, boom, boom, boom
She give me butterflies and they won't go away away, away

"Love you, need you, need you here to stay."

Future
You said, "I come in peace," so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone

You don't know what they're like if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen listen, listen

Don't try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet's outside there waiting
I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn't have a friend, didn't know what it was
You taught me how to dream and how to love
You're my best friend, please listen to me

You don't know what they're like if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen listen, listen

They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever

No stopping her now, no stopping her now
Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets

She's got my attention, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
And I'm down with it

She said it's her first time oh, ya, ya
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn oh, ya, ya, and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an addict
Got me twisted oh, ya, ya, but still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive. I could still smell her perfume
It's not hard to notice that I'm open
Hypnotized by the way she moves
Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident

Girl, I’m ready, if you’re ready, now
Ooh, as I'm ever gonna be
If you're with it, then I'm with it, now
To accept all the responsibility
I'd go outta my way
To live by the words that you say
I don't wanna be the same

Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right
Change me, change me

Don’t fight fire with fire
If I’m screaming, talk quieter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that I’m facing
Be like serenity, help re-position my mind
Take a chance, make a difference in my life

Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right
Change me, change me

Nights like this don't happen anymore oh girl

Is it me, and did I lose control?

Lonely overseas
Only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
But it fell before our eyes

Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

It's been difficult
I'm just happy there's no fights no more
But it's nights like this that I never ever missed you more
If there's a reason what this happened for
But I can't help but feel like

But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me

Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky,
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Why should we fight the feeling
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

'Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With the thought of you, with the thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
Not the things you do, but the thought of you

You-hoo-hoo, you-hoo-hoo
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you
Not the things you do, but the thought of you
You-hoo-hoo, you-hoo-hoo
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you
Say you love me
As much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?

Would you lie to me, baby?
'Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is...

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

Mmm, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, alright [2x]

Ooh, baby, I know loving you ain't easy
But sure is worth a try

Ooh, if there is a reason
To call me a fool
'Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?

If this a lesson
Then, baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you, you, you

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is...

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

Basically I'm saying here
I can't live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me
Ain't no need for contemplating
Promise you won't keep me waiting
Tell me, baby, I'm all that you need

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

If I could die in your arms
I'mma make you believe, girl
That I wouldn't mind, no

Don't stop baby, no
alright
It's what you do to me, yeah
Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, whoa, ooh-whoa
Baby, please don't go, girl
No, no, no, no
Whoa, ooh
Well, let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

Did you know that I loved you or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let ya
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well, I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well, I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand

Well, did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone
Every time he done wrong I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out

What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let ya
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall

But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your...
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let ya
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall,

So fall in love in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all don't have to be scared, don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let ya
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall

If you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your... let yourself fall
The sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be? Could this be happening to me?

We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what am I supposed to do?

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby, now it's time for us
Tryna keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo
Catching feelings doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo

In my head we're already together
I'm good alone but with you I'm better
I just wanna see you smile
You say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere

I'm just tryna see where this can take us
'Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious
I think I finally got it done
Now all that's left to do now is get out the mirror
And say it to her

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby, now it's time for us
Tryna keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo
Catching feelings doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo

Should I tell her how I really feel how I really feel
Or should I move in close or just be still? how will I know?
'Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand
Will everything change?
How do I know if she feels the same?

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby, now it's time for us
Tryna to keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo
Catching feelings doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo

You see my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going that's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool
Trying to be cool
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for us
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

See my baby really needs some help
Cause she can never stay at home by herself
She says she needs a little company
Even if she's not always with me, yeah

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for us
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

Why can't I find you love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh I, I must be blind
How did I let you get away? Yeah, yeah

I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for us
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love

I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high

Cause whenever
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey

Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know

If you need me
I'll come runnin'
From a thousand miles away
When you smile I smile oh whoa

You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more

Cause my cards are on the table
And I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish
Cause it's my command
Hey hey hey

With you, with you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

Now Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and
It's reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you can't love me, hey

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts and
It's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me, hey

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah oh no no no

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space and space
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
For you I'd write a symphony,
I'd tell the violin,
It's time to sink or swim,
Watch them play for ya,
For you I'd be, whoa oh
Running a thousand miles,
Just to get to where you are.

Step to the beat of my heart,
I don't need a whole lot,
But for you I admit I,
I'd rather give you the world,
Or we can share mine,
I know I won't be the first one,
giving you all this attention,

Smile for me.

Every second, every single time,
Spend it like my last dime.

Step to the beat of my heart,

But for you I admit I,

Or we can share mine,

[Ludacris:]
Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh

My friends say I'm a fool to think
That you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love

'Cause honestly the truth is that
You know I'm never leaving
'Cause you're my angel sent from above

Baby, you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love you, love you
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above you, above you

Love me, love me

Oh, how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

People try to tell me
But I still refuse to listen
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh, your love

Baby, you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love you, love you
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above you, above you

When I close my eyes
I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long
For this day to come
Now that it's here
Let's make it special

I can't deny
There's so many thoughts in my mind
The DJ is playing my favorite song favorite song
Ain't no chaperons chaperons
This could be the night of your dreams

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give give it, give the first dance to me give it to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth
Under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor I can't deny

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song favorite song
Now we're all alone all alone
Here's the opportunity

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give give it, give the first dance to me give it to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Everybody says we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
That's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine

If you just give, give your first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
But we gotta do it slowly
If you give give, give the first dance to me give the first dance, baby
I'm gon' cherish every moment oh, oh, oh
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
If you give give it, give the first dance to me give it to me

'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart

So, we fight, so, we fight through the hurt, through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live, and we live, and we learn, and we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So, it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
Back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth,

So, tell me how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So, tell me why am I in tears?
Whoa, so far away. And now I just need you here
We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road to get to your heart?
Let's start over again
Fell so far away
From where we used to be
And now we're standing
And where do we go when there's no road
To get to your heart?

And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
